CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIZATION:
        - Do NOT use generic categories like "Provider Issue" or "Customer Service". 
        - Use SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE categories that describe the operational failure.
        - Normalize similar causes (e.g., "Driver late", "Tow truck delayed" -> "ETA Exceeded").
        
        Recommended Categories (expand if necessary, but keep granularity similar):
        - "Dispatch Accuracy - Wrong Equipment" (e.g., sent wheel lift instead of flatbed)
        - "Dispatch Accuracy - Wrong Location" (e.g., driver sent to wrong address)
        - "Customer Request - Change Drop-off Location" (e.g., user wants to tow to different shop)
        - "Customer Request - Change Pick-up Location" (e.g., user moved car or location was inaccurate)
        - "Customer Request - Service Upgrade" (e.g., jumpstart failed, needs tow)
        - "Provider Operations - ETA Exceeded" (e.g., driver significantly late)
        - "Provider Operations - No Show" (e.g., driver cancelled or never arrived)
        - "Provider Operations - Unprofessional Conduct"
